This Weather Dashboard is a React application that provides real-time weather updates, a 5-day forecast, and allows users to manage their favorite cities. The application uses the OpenWeatherMap API for fetching weather data and a JSON server for managing favorite cities.

Features:
-> Display current weather (temperature, description, city, country).
-> Display a 5-day weather forecast.
-> Add and remove cities from the favorites list.
-> Dynamically styled UI based on temperature (hot, mild, cold backgrounds).
